                            <p>
                                At the moment I’m working in a new AAA game as Gameplay programmer related with Animation.
                                <br/>
                                My main duties are design and implement new Animation systems for all the different characters on the game, working with Technical Animators and programmers. Also, I’m involved in new Gameplay systems as Ledge-Grabs of GameplaySequences.
                                <br/>
                                I am responsible of the creation of new systems to allow my team the creation, implementation and debug of new animations and behaviours in game.
                                <br/>
                                I work close to the AI team so create a good combination between “what” the character wants to do and “how” is going to do it.
                                <br/>
                                I’m responsible of design and plan any new task related with my field.

                            <p>
                                I am working as part of a large team on Morpheme/Euphoria, an industry leading Animation authoring tool and engine for AAA Games.
                                <br/>
                                I designed and planned new featuers, hosted meetings and implemented them colaborating with other members of the team. One of the most significant pieces of work I undertook was the design and development of blend shapes support (including debuggig) within the authoring tool. In this I worked extensively with our propriatary scene graph and rendering pipeline.
                                <br/>
                                I assumed responsibility for XMD, our prprotary animation format, and supported it for the latest release cycle. This required supporting plugins for Maya, 3DS Max and Motion Builder as well as the XMD codebase.
                                <br/>
                                As a part of the team I also did mantanance work and bug fixing on the codebase which titals 1.5 million lines of code.
                                <br/>
                                I assisted with the mentoring of new starters and interns and am currenty managing the intern program.
