This project was created for the GameJam PROCJAM 2016.

In this game, you should help our robot friend Frank to escape from the building.

The strange thing is that each floor seems totally different from the previous one, like if it has been created procedural ( ;) ). Also, the other big issue is that Frank is not completely operative, so he can only move following his internal rhythm! So each pulse, he will move in the direction that you choose!

And not only that, but there are teleporters between rooms, which makes thing easy to move but change randomly the internal rhythm of Frank...what a mess!!

I hope you enjoy the game and please, any feedback just let me know it :)
