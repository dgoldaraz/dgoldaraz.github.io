You have been involved in a new scientific test! Some doctors discovered a strange thing that produces bubbles. You need to destroy all the bubbles so the science can go forward!.

This is the classic PANG game adapted to a new visual environment in Unity. The game try to capture the old essence of the game, but adding new items and components to give it a new Sci-fi style.
