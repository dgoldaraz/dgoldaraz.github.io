This is a basic experimental project to test different PathFinding Algorithms​ (Dijkstra and A*)using Unity. To that pourpose, I created a basic grid where the user can create walls and decide the target to reach. Then the different algorithm will show how the player creates and follow the path to reach the destination.

This example has a set of utilities for the user to test the pathfinding. This means that there are two different cameras (Ortho-Graphic and perspective), the user can do multiselection of tiles (pressing Alt) and decide the use of diagonal movements or not.
