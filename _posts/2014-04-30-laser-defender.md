            <p>This is an Arcade game where you need to reach the maximum distance on your escape from the big Company. To do that, you should avoid any collision and you need to destroy different squadrons. </p>
            <p class="hidden-xs">This game, made in Unity, has a dynamic difficult system of squadrons/ships. Depending on the distance covered, the squadrons will dynamically change and increase the difficulty. Also it includes a set of <em>"initial players"</em>  that allows to decide different ways of play.</p>
