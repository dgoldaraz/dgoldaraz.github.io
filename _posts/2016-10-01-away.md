This game was made for the GBJam5. The rules of this game jam where to create a GameBoy style game, with a low resolution (160x144) and four colors.

The theme of this game it's a mix between infinite scroller and stealth game, based on games like MGS. The aim of the player it's avoid the different obstacles (generated procedurally), avoid/kill the enemies and avoid get raised by the spot Light on the left.

I worked in a group of six (3 programers, 2 artist and a musician) to create it. My role in this game (as a creator and programmer) was related with the main gameplays of the game and the creation of the procedural generator.
